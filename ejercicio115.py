# Exercise 115
"""
Implement a function called multi(),
which accepts an iterable object (list, tuple) as an argument and returns the
product of all elements of this iterable object.
Example:
[IN]: multi((-4, 6, 2))
[OUT]: -48
[IN]: multi([4, 2, -5])
[OUT]: -40
Note! You only need to define the function.
